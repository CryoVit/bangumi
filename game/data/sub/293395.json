Geometry repeats infinitely in every direction and falling down leads you back to where you started. Manipulate gravity to change your perspective and see the world in new ways. Master the rules of the universe and restore a barren world with vegetation and life. \r\nIn November 2012, William Chyr began working on Manifold Garden. Initially called Relativity, the game was inspired by the M.C. Escher print which depicts a world with multiple gravities. In early 2015, Manifold Garden was backed by Indie Fund. Over the course of its development, the game has been shown in over 20 game conventions and festivals, including E3, Tokyo Game Show, Gamercamp, and IndieCade East.\r\nKey Features\r\nAn expansive and visually striking world filled with mind-bending puzzles.\r\nManipulate gravity to gain new perspectives and walk on any visible surface.\r\nExperience space in new ways as you explore infinitely repeating Escher-esque architecture.\r\nCreated by William Chyr Studio","name":"Manifold Garden","name_cn":"流形花园","tags":[{"name":"PC","count":12},{"name":"解谜","count":9},{"name":"PUZ","count":6},{"name":"独立游戏","count":6},{"name":"2020","count":3},{"name":"四维空间","count":2},{"name":"重力解谜","count":2},{"name":"STEAM","count":2},{"name":"interested","count":1},{"name":"空间解谜","count":1},{"name":"itch","count":1},{"name":"Puzzle","count":1},{"name":"美国","count":1},{"name":"IOS","count":1},{"name":"EN","count":1},{"name":"已白金","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"流形花园"},{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"PC"},{"v":"iOS"},{"v":"PS4"},{"v":"Xbox One"}]},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"Puzzle"},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"1"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2019年10月18日 (Epic Games)"},{"key":"售价","value":"12.99 USD"},{"key":"website","value":"https://manifold.garden"}],"rating":{"rank":2006,"total":28,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":1,"4":0,"5":0,"6":5,"7":7,"8":11,"9":2,"10":2},"score":7.4},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":6,"dropped":4,"wish":33,"collect":29,"doing":7},"id":293395,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
