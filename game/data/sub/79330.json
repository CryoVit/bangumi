Innovative in gameplay, the game was very popular for many years.\r\n\r\nIn the game, the player assumes the role of a spy who infiltrates a building filled with elevators. He must collect secret documents from the building and traverse the 30 floors of the building using an increasingly complex series of elevators. The player is pursued by enemy agents who appear from behind closed doors. These agents must be dealt with via force or evasion. Successful completion of a level involves collecting all the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems are so complex that some puzzle-solving skills are needed.","name":"Elevator Action","name_cn":"电梯大战","tags":[{"name":"FC","count":15},{"name":"GBA","count":5},{"name":"ACT","count":4},{"name":"ARCADE","count":3},{"name":"平台动作游戏","count":2},{"name":"1983","count":2},{"name":"TAITO","count":2},{"name":".","count":2},{"name":"六星","count":2},{"name":"ARC","count":2}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"电梯大战"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"エレベーターアクション"}]},{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"FC"},{"v":"ARC"}]},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"ACT"},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"1-2"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"1983 ; FC(1985)"},{"key":"制作发行","value":"TAITO"}],"rating":{"rank":5261,"total":26,"count":{"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":10,"7":7,"8":3,"9":1,"10":0},"score":6},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":1,"dropped":5,"wish":1,"collect":46,"doing":0},"id":79330,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
