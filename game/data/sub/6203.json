Nod`s leader and GDI`s public enemy #1, Kane, resurfaces from an apparently faked death nearly 40 years after the initial conflict, which sets off the Second Tiberium War between the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod. The game`s theme also subtly revolves around the question of why Tiberium came to Earth in the first place, with the discovery of what appears to be an alien spacecraft and a mysterious object known as the Tacitus.","name":"Command \u0026amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun","name_cn":"命令与征服2：泰伯利亚之日","tags":[{"name":"RTS","count":12},{"name":"C\u0026C","count":11},{"name":"westwood","count":11},{"name":"PC","count":5},{"name":"命令与征服","count":3},{"name":"经典","count":3},{"name":"EA","count":2},{"name":"西木头","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"命令与征服2：泰伯利亚之日"},{"key":"平台","value":"PC"},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"RTS"},{"key":"游戏开发商","value":"Westwood Studios"},{"key":"发行商","value":"Electronic Arts"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"1999-08-27"}],"rating":{"rank":2645,"total":59,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":1,"5":3,"6":12,"7":19,"8":17,"9":5,"10":2},"score":7.2},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":2,"dropped":3,"wish":2,"collect":84,"doing":1},"id":6203,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
