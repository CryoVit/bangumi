The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.\r\n\r\nPlaying as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield bombardment abilities.\r\n\r\nShortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal new combined campaign. Merging the landmasses of The Old World plus Naggaroth, Lustria, Ulthuan and the Southlands into a single epic map, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.","name":"Total War: WARHAMMER II","name_cn":"全面战争：战锤 2","tags":[{"name":"全面战争","count":28},{"name":"RTS","count":22},{"name":"战锤","count":19},{"name":"PC","count":15},{"name":"CA","count":11},{"name":"魔幻","count":7},{"name":"SEGA","count":7},{"name":"欧美系","count":5},{"name":"STEAM","count":4},{"name":"2017","count":4},{"name":"欧美","count":2},{"name":"SLG","count":1},{"name":"大战略","count":1},{"name":"GW","count":1},{"name":"2021玩过","count":1},{"name":"20小时","count":1},{"name":"40","count":1},{"name":"奇幻","count":1},{"name":"warhammer","count":1},{"name":"其他","count":1},{"name":"TotalWar","count":1},{"name":"策略","count":1},{"name":"2020","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"全面战争：战锤 2"},{"key":"平台","value":"PC"},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"RTS"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2017年9月28日"},{"key":"开发商","value":"Creative Assembly"}],"rating":{"rank":777,"total":113,"count":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":1,"6":6,"7":18,"8":61,"9":22,"10":4},"score":7.9},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":9,"dropped":6,"wish":22,"collect":120,"doing":17},"id":215075,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
