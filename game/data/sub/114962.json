The game is an open world video game and players will have the freedom to pursue side quests and roam around the world.\r\n\r\nThe game allows people to create new characters and customize Talion as he starts his journey throughout Middle-earth by using a new system called the Nemesis System which remembers the player's interactions with specific types of characters they will encounter in the game and adjusts the manner in which these characters will react to the player throughout the game. Enemies will also develop as Talion interacts with them; for example, an Uruk who was thrown into a fire by Talion might want revenge on him for being burned and disfigured.\r\n\r\nThe player will have the option to level up the abilities of Talion both as a ranger and as a Wraith through two distinct skill trees.Ranger abilities allow Talion to move silently through environments without attracting attention, while Wraith abilities will allow him to impose his will on enemies, and have them gather information for him, spread tales of Talion among enemies to decrease their morale, or assassinate their leaders.\r\n\r\nIn February 2014, Monolith Productions announced that the Nemesis System, being a large system, will be reduced in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 releases, also stating that they were \"focusing on the next-gen platforms,\" meaning the PlayStation 4, PC, and Xbox One systems. Furthermore, they stated that they're \"going to do whatever we can to get as much as possible on current-gen.\" Monolith Productions also stated that \"some of the stuff,\" meaning the \"core mechanics,\" which are combat, stealth, ranger abilities and movements, the basic control and gameplay, will be the same on both generations of gaming consoles.","name":"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor","name_cn":"中土世界：摩多暗影","tags":[{"name":"ACT","count":29},{"name":"PC","count":22},{"name":"指环王","count":14},{"name":"Middle-earth:Shadow_of_Mordor","count":10},{"name":"STEAM","count":6},{"name":"PS4","count":4},{"name":"2015","count":3},{"name":"AAVG","count":2},{"name":"欧美系","count":2},{"name":"XboxOne","count":2},{"name":"MonolithProductions","count":2},{"name":"60-","count":1},{"name":"小于10小时","count":1},{"name":"终于","count":1},{"name":"拥有","count":1},{"name":"Monolith","count":1},{"name":"ARPG","count":1},{"name":"RPG","count":1},{"name":"3A","count":1},{"name":"四公主非单线程","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"中土世界：摩多暗影"},{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"PS4"},{"v":"PS3"},{"v":"XBOX ONE"},{"v":"XBOX 360"},{"v":"PC"}]},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"ACT"},{"key":"游戏引擎","value":"LithTech Jupiter EX"},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"Single-player"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2014-09-30"},{"key":"售价","value":"$49.99"},{"key":"website","value":"https://www.shadowofmordor.com/"},{"key":"开发","value":"Monolith Productions"},{"key":"发行","value":"Warner Bros.
