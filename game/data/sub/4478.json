Drake is physically adept and is able to jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking up behind them to knock them out with one hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. If all of the foes patrolling an area are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.","name":"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves","name_cn":"神秘海域2：纵横四海","tags":[{"name":"PS3","count":109},{"name":"神秘海域2","count":65},{"name":"NaughtyDog","count":54},{"name":"ACT","count":44},{"name":"PS4","count":37},{"name":"TPS","count":35},{"name":"巅峰级画面","count":34},{"name":"顽皮狗","count":30},{"name":"神秘海域","count":21},{"name":"香格里拉","count":20},{"name":"船长万岁","count":14},{"name":"SCE","count":14},{"name":"可怜的香格里拉","count":13},{"name":"解谜","count":7},{"name":"AAVG","count":5},{"name":"2009","count":4},{"name":"冒險","count":3},{"name":"画面好","count":3},{"name":"索尼","count":2},{"name":"视频通关","count":2},{"name":"ADV","count":2},{"name":"AVG","count":2},{"name":"神作","count":2},{"name":"PSPLUS","count":1},{"name":"88","count":1},{"name":"看过视频","count":1},{"name":"xxxx","count":1},{"name":"三公主","count":1},{"name":"FPS不足不穩定","count":1},{"name":"9★","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"神秘海域2：纵横四海"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"秘境探险2：盗亦有道"}]},{"key":"平台","value":"PS3"},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"TPS"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2009-10-13"},{"key":"售价","value":"$59.99"},{"key":"游戏开发商","value":"Naughty Dog"},{"key":"发行商","value":"SCEA"}],"rating":{"rank":219,"total":459,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":1,"4":1,"5":2,"6":18,"7":81,"8":146,"9":146,"10":64},"score":8.3},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":33,"dropped":12,"wish":103,"collect":564,"doing":29},"id":4478,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
