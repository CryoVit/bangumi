It's very educating, and it'll make children understand how to run properly when they grow older.\r\n\r\nWe suggest parents to show this wonderful game to any little girl or boy they may think might want to run the Olympics someday.\r\n\r\nThe name \"QWOP\" is from the fact that you only need the keyboard letters Q, W, O and P to play.\r\n\r\n(Note: The author of this post has been taking lithium after going in complete depression after playing QWOP. Side effects to this game may not vary. All reactions have been proven the same: an urge to hit a baby, having blue vision, eating their own shit, having uncontrollable periods {both male and female}, listening to static in a bright red room and/or randomly yelling at their neighbor's wall asking for a Twinkie. See a doctor if any child has these symptoms or if they start having other strange behavior after one minute of playing this flash game.)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfrom Urban Dictionary\r\nhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=qwop\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGame Information from The Indie Game Database\r\nhttp://db.tigsource.com/games/qwop","name":"QWOP","name_cn":"","tags":[{"name":"骨骼惊奇","count":25},{"name":"少俠好功夫","count":20},{"name":"PC","count":19},{"name":"qwop","count":13},{"name":"猎奇","count":12},{"name":"折磨人","count":10},{"name":"flash","count":9},{"name":"勵志","count":8},{"name":"运动游戏","count":6},{"name":"ETC","count":3},{"name":"SPG","count":2},{"name":"私心推薦","count":2},{"name":"惊","count":2},{"name":"两星","count":1},{"name":"休闲","count":1},{"name":"励志","count":1},{"name":"不評分","count":1},{"name":"欧美系","count":1},{"name":"端游","count":1},{"name":"折磨","count":1},{"name":"运动","count":1},{"name":"谁放上来的","count":1},{"name":"同人","count":1},{"name":"ACT","count":1},{"name":"indie","count":1},{"name":"的","count":1},{"name":"WIN","count":1},{"name":"坑爹","count":1},{"name":"Sports","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"iOS"},{"v":"Web"},{"v":"Android"}]},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"体育"},{"key":"游戏引擎","value":"Flash、HTML5"},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"1"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2008-11-12 (Web)"},{"key":"售价","value":"Free"},{"key":"官方网站","value":"http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html"}],"rating":{"rank":4073,"total":119,"count":{"1":5,"2":4,"3":3,"4":5,"5":16,"6":15,"7":18,"8":23,"9":9,"10":21},"score":6.8},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":1,"dropped":6,"wish":8,"collect":162,"doing":1},"id":10611,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
