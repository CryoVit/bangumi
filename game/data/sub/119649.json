As the difficulty increases, the tension mounts, and a peculiar narrative unfolds. \r\n\r\nTim Shiel is a composer/producer based in Melbourne. Tim is known to some as Faux Pas, the moniker under which he released a steady stream of constantly shifting electronic music for many years. He is also known for his work as a broadcaster at Melbourne independent radio station 3RRR FM, and for his recent role as multi-instrumentalist in Gotye's live band. His passion for gaming and his fluid approach to composing have led him to team up with local game development studio Kumobius, to provide the soundtrack and in-game sound design for their minimalist new mobile game, Duet.","name":"DUET","name_cn":"二重奏","tags":[{"name":"IOS","count":12},{"name":"手游","count":11},{"name":"PUZ","count":7},{"name":"2013","count":5},{"name":"Android","count":4},{"name":"跑酷","count":3},{"name":"极简","count":3},{"name":"indie","count":2},{"name":"Mobile","count":2},{"name":"补记","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1},{"name":"2015","count":1},{"name":"STEAM","count":1},{"name":"手机","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"二重奏"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"duetgame"}]},{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"Android"},{"v":"iOS"}]},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"1"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2013-10-10"},{"key":"website","value":"http://www.duetgame.com"}],"rating":{"rank":2968,"total":49,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":1,"5":1,"6":11,"7":19,"8":13,"9":4,"10":0},"score":7.1},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":3,"dropped":3,"wish":3,"collect":71,"doing":1},"id":119649,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
