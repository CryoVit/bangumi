Firestorm featured several new units and structures for both factions, and told a story where GDI and Nod were shown as being compelled to reluctantly join forces in order to overcome Nod\\'s renegade artificial intelligence, CABAL. Prior to the release of Command \u0026 Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars in 2007, Firestorm\\'s storyline was unique in the Command \u0026 Conquer series as it was the first to feature ending sequences for the GDI and Nod factions which took place simultaneously, and both of which were considered as official canon storyline. By contrast, only the actions and events which occurred during the GDI campaigns were considered canon story throughout all other Command \u0026 Conquer games, with the events portrayed in the Brotherhood of Nod campaigns having traditionally been treated as alternate \\\"what if\\\" realities.","name":"Command \u0026amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun – Firestorm","name_cn":"命令与征服2：泰伯利亚之日：烈火风暴","tags":[{"name":"westwood","count":4},{"name":"RTS","count":3},{"name":"C\u0026C","count":2},{"name":"EA","count":2},{"name":"经典","count":2},{"name":"2000","count":1},{"name":"PC","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"命令与征服2：泰伯利亚之日：烈火风暴"},{"key":"平台","value":"PC"},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"RTS"},{"key":"游戏开发商","value":"Westwood Studios"},{"key":"发行商","value":"Electronic Arts"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2000-03-07"}],"rating":{"rank":2433,"total":34,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":2,"6":3,"7":17,"8":9,"9":2,"10":1},"score":7.3},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":0,"dropped":1,"wish":4,"collect":51,"doing":0},"id":6204,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
