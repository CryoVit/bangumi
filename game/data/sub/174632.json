And will you be able to smile in the end?\r\n\r\nNarcissu is a thought provoking visual novel series about terminal illness, living, dying, and the relationship between those leaving and those left behind. There are no miracles, no heroes, no villains in this story. Just life and the characters finding their own ways of facing death in an indifferent, relentless, ever-impartial reality.\r\n\r\nPraised by fans for its moving story and high production quality, the original games have been download over a million times and spawned a manga and light novel, and has been localized in several languages across the world. This anthology finally brings the games that were never released outside of Japan in any form to the world for eager fans, as well as updating artwork, voice work, and a brand new written chapter exclusive to this anthology: \"Sumire\".\r\n\r\nFurther breaking new grounds, this anthology builds on the massively popular music which has captured the hearts of thousands of Narcissu fans by adding 2 video game legends to the musical roster: Chris Huelsbeck of Turrican fame, and Hiroki Kikuta of Secret of Mana fame.\r\n\r\nThe story is told in 5 games and produced through a successful Kickstarter campaign. The original games (Narcissu 1st\u00262nd) of the series are available for free on Steam. This anthology series will contain an additional 4 scenarios in the series.","name":"Narcissu 10th Anniversary Anthology Project","name_cn":"","tags":[{"name":"galgame","count":134},{"name":"水仙","count":123},{"name":"片岡とも","count":100},{"name":"narcissu","count":73},{"name":"致郁","count":42},{"name":"GAL","count":40},{"name":"STEAM","count":37},{"name":"治愈","count":36},{"name":"PC","count":34},{"name":"AVG","count":20},{"name":"stagenana","count":11},{"name":"2016","count":11},{"name":"小品","count":9},{"name":"ADV","count":7},{"name":"神作","count":5},{"name":"ステージ☆なな","count":4},{"name":"生死观","count":3},{"name":"合集","count":2},{"name":"2016年","count":2},{"name":"死生観","count":2},{"name":"全年龄","count":2},{"name":"6","count":1},{"name":"盘4","count":1},{"name":"84.37","count":1},{"name":"其他（未归类、优质）","count":1},{"name":"劇情向","count":1},{"name":"interested","count":1},{"name":"生肉","count":1},{"name":"汉化","count":1},{"name":"剧情","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"PC"}]},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"ADV"},{"key":"游戏引擎","value":"NScripter"},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"1"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2016年1月28日"},{"key":"售价","value":[{"v":"$2.99"},{"v":"JPY¥ 298"},{"v":"CNY¥ 15"}]},{"key":"游戏开发商","value":"ステージなな"}],"rating":{"rank":30,"total":336,"count":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":2,"6":5,"7":19,"8":86,"9":132,"10":91},"score":8.8},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":38,"dropped":10,"wish":479,"collect":432,"doing":53},"id":174632,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
