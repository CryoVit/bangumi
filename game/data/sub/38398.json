A mobile spinoff of the game, developed by Hidden Variable Studios and published by Line, was released for Android and iOS devices in May 2017.\r\nIn Skullgirls, players engage in combat against one another, with teams of one, two, or three characters attempting to knock out their opponents or have the most cumulative health when time runs out. The setting of the game revolves around the \"Skull Heart\", an artifact which grants wishes for women. If a wisher with an impure soul uses the Skull Heart, she is transformed into the next \"Skullgirl\", a monster bent on destruction. Skullgirls received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation and gameplay mechanics, while criticizing its limited roster size and online multiplayer features.","name":"Skullgirls","name_cn":"骷髅少女","tags":[{"name":"FTG","count":19},{"name":"PC","count":18},{"name":"STEAM","count":8},{"name":"ACT","count":8},{"name":"手柄","count":4},{"name":"格斗","count":4},{"name":"PS3","count":3},{"name":"本地多人","count":3},{"name":"普通游戏","count":1},{"name":"已购","count":1},{"name":"LabZeroGames","count":1},{"name":"分屏游玩","count":1},{"name":"日系","count":1},{"name":"PSV","count":1},{"name":"独立游戏","count":1},{"name":"2012","count":1},{"name":"画面精细","count":1},{"name":"PS4","count":1},{"name":"赞！","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"骷髅少女"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"骷髅女孩"},{"v":"スカルガールズ"}]},{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"PS3"},{"v":"Xbox 360"},{"v":"PC"},{"v":"PS4"},{"v":"PS Vita"},{"v":"Xbox One"},{"v":"Arcade"},{"v":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"FTG"},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"1 - 2人"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2012年04月10日"}],"rating":{"rank":2084,"total":54,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":1,"6":7,"7":20,"8":23,"9":2,"10":1},"score":7.4},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":10,"dropped":6,"wish":26,"collect":75,"doing":7},"id":38398,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
