It was released on December 7, 2007 for Windows after more than two years of development. A Mac port was released November 12, 2008, courtesy of Ambrosia Software. An updated version of the game was released on Steam on December 15, 2008. A Linux version of the game was released with the Humble Indie Bundle and the source code will be released under the GNU General Public License as a result of reaching the US$1 million goal. The game won the Seumas McNally grand prize from the Independent Games Festival in March 2007, and has been praised by reviewers for its visuals and atmosphere. On November 14, 2009, the Aquaria soundtrack album was made available for sale. It includes all of the music in the game as well as a new nine-minute vocal track and a few remixes.\r\n\r\nThe game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she explores the underwater world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns about both the history of the world and her own past. The gameplay is focused on a combination of swimming and singing, through which Naija can interact with the world. Songs sung by Naija can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural shape.\r\n-----wikipedia-----","name":"Aquaria","name_cn":"安琪拉之歌","tags":[{"name":"独立游戏","count":23},{"name":"PC","count":15},{"name":"AVG","count":15},{"name":"音乐美","count":10},{"name":"手绘","count":9},{"name":"ACT","count":7},{"name":"indie","count":6},{"name":"2007","count":3},{"name":"Metroidvania","count":2},{"name":"创意","count":2},{"name":"ADV","count":2},{"name":"AAVG","count":1},{"name":"奇幻","count":1},{"name":"IOS","count":1},{"name":"Android","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"安琪拉之歌"},{"key":"平台","value":[{"v":"PC"},{"v":"iOS"},{"v":"Android"}]},{"key":"游戏类型","value":"AAVG"},{"key":"游玩人数","value":"1人"},{"key":"发行日期","value":"2007-12-07"},{"key":"售价","value":"$9.99"},{"key":"website","value":"http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/"},{"key":"开发","value":"Bit Blot"},{"key":"发行","value":"Bit Blot"},{"key":"作曲","value":"Alec Holowka"}],"rating":{"rank":1535,"total":60,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":2,"4":0,"5":4,"6":4,"7":18,"8":14,"9":13,"10":5},"score":7.6},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":12,"dropped":15,"wish":44,"collect":61,"doing":3},"id":5958,"eps":0,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":4}
